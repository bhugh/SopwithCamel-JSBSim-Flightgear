    name:           Clerget9B
    type:           piston
    power:          130 hp
    augmented?      no
    injected?       no
    
    the clerget 130hp 9b is as follows:

no. of cylinders...........................9
bore..........................................120 mm
stroke........................................160 mm
weight complete...........................381 lbs
compression ratio..........................4:1
normal h.p....................................130
effective h.p.................................135
r.p.m...........................................12 50
oil consumption per h.p. hour............   0.09 pints
petrol consumption per h.p. hour.......   0.74 pints
[0.74 pints = 0.0925 gallons; 6.073 pounds per gallon of gasoline =   .5617525 pounds per hp hr.       In grams per kW hr that is  341.701125 ]

But it seems to effect idle power, too:  	This value affects the throttle fall off and the engine stops running if it is slowed below 80% of this value. The engine starts running when it reaches 80% of this value. 
  
  Setting this quite low allows the engine to re-start again when the RPM is quite low, which is realistic for a Clerget.  But, it allows allows a super-low power idle on throttle alone, which is not very realistic.  But, we can just limit throttle throw in jsb.xml, solving that problem.-->

For a rotary engine, usually on magneto switch activated 5 cylinders & the other, the remaining 4 cyclinders.  So we're saying one magneto is  4/9 power drop, or 5/9 of total power. We don't have as good a way of simulating the 4/9 power setting here, unfortunately, but we do it instead in sopwithCamel1F1jsb.xml under <scheduled_gain name="fcs/throttle_limit_by_magento"> where we just scale down the throttle by about 1/9.
  ver 2.0gamma: 0.44444  Trying .17 again. .17 gives about 81 hp whereas we need about 62 hp to similate 5/9 power, so trying 0.32 which gives 57 hp.  Trying 0.295 which gives about 60-61 hp. -->

1288rpm
122.8hp
14.73gph

right mag only = 49.8hp @ 14.73gph
left mag only = 21.1hp @ 10.5gph

With your engine you might want to consider a Ve of 0.55 and a BSFC of 0.423

which would give you
130hp
12.04gph
