CHANGES/UPDATES/THINGS DONE
===========================

VER 2.0
-------

* Major updates to Flight Dynamics Model, significant better fit to historically 
reported behavior.  Went through every one of more than 60 characteristics of the Camel I've identified from historical accounts (all listed in the NOTES file 
in the /docs directory), tested each one, tweaked the FDM a bit here and there 
to put the final touches on the FDM updates I've been working on over the past 
two years.  It's very noticeably improved from ver. 1.6 in several areas.

* Ground contact effects: Dust, dirt, wake when wheels, tail, prop, fuselage etc 
contact the ground or water

* Major updates and improvements to realism of engine managment and blipping. Additionally, you can now clearly hear the difference between different engine settings, RPM levels, blip settings, etc. See detailed explanation below.

* Parts break: Wheels, undercarriage, & prop will break if they contact the 
ground with too much force. Visual, audio, & physics affects of broken parts are 
apparent--ie, if you hit the ground too hard the wheel breaks off and you hear it and feel it, and the aircraft behaves differently with no wheel.

* Ground/water crash behavior much improved; solved problems with JSBSim when 
violent ground crashes occur. Pilot is kicked out of plane in crash,
explosionsound, smoke/dust clouds, (some) parts break appropriately, somewhat 
reasonable aircraft physics displayed @ crash (vs previous versions that tended 
to just 'bounce off the ground')

* Sound effects: Blip, air rushing (useful for detecting stall/overspeed), 
overspeed whooshing, high G creaks & ominous rumbles, landing gear and 
taildragger rumble, if you touch a wing it slides, water landings have their own 
sound effects, buffeting aloft, etc.  Wheel thump on landing, tail dragging (and 
lifting) sounds, other sounds that help you know what's going on. Sound effects 
help you make a connection between what you're doing in the aircraft and the 
world you are interacting with, so I've tried to include sound effects that help 
you know what is going on with the aircraft.

* Project Rembrandt compatibility: The model is now Rembrandt-ready and looks 
great when run with Project Rembrandt rendering. Thanks to FG Camel authors 
for creating/updating the Camel model used here.  Project Rembrandt allows a 
better graphics experience for those with higher-end systems, including shadow 
rendering etc. (Complete, ver. 2.0)

* Repair aircraft after crash or parts broken: Available in Camel/Repair menu or 
automatically completed when appropriate choice is made in 'crash menu'. 

* Improved documentation.

* "Nudge":  If landed and stuck in a field or in the countryside somewhere, and 
just can't quite get moving, pressing 'n' gives you a little push to get 
you going and unstuck.

* New 'Inspect Aircraft View' based on FG's WalkView. I quite like this because 
you can easily maneuver your way to any given spot around the aircraft--behind 
the tail, in front of the nose, beside the pilot, whatever, and just stay there. 
Select using 'v' and maneuver with wasd WASD and mouse for view direction.

* Chocks: Chocks actually work and are placed by default when you initially spawn in on the ground. Activate/deactivate via Shift-B.

* SHADOWS! Fuselage shadow now displays, when using ALS graphics mode (View/
Rendering Options/Check "ALS")

Various bug fixes and minor updates completed in this release:

X Often (incorrectly) detects view/select airport change as  'crash'.  (Complete, ver. 2.0)
 
X Low pass filter for 'bumpiness'.  Still bumpy but a smoother type of bumps. (Complete, ver. 2.0)
 
X Inspect Aircraft View keys interfere with a/A for time speedup/slowdown, and perhaps other keys. (Fixed, ver. 2.0)

X Taildragger sound could be replaced with something more specific/realistic. Also a 'thump' sound added when the tail hits hard. (Complete, ver. 2.0)

X Tail dragger sound is a bit inconsistent at low speeds (Fixed, ver. 2.0)

X Tracers look like long rods instead of glowing streaks. (Fixed 2.0delta)

X Don't start engine/kick starter if blip switch is depressed & a magneto is 
switched, or if both magnetos are off & blip switch released.

X Smoke keeps coming off wings etc on some occasions even when in air (fix issue with no update to wake-dust-factor when the a/c is more than 100 ft altitude AGL).

X Transition from tail drag to tail fly @ 20-35-40 KTS is difficult, rudder seems to have insufficient control authority, or some interaction between ground & aero forces. [some improvement to this in ver 2.0]

X Engine control: Ver. 2.0 is greatly improved over 1.8, but perhaps some way can be found to cajole JSBSim into duplicating magneto power settings even more accurately.  Maybe JSBSim boost could be used to give more distinct engine power
settings.


VER 2.0 ENGINE UPDATE - DETAILS & PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR PILOTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Major updates and improvements to realism of engine managment and blip switches: Rotary engines develop a large amount of thrust very quickly when the blip switch is replaced. JSBSim's engine model wants to slowly ramp-up engine power over a few seconds. In Ver. 2.0 we have found a good workaround for develop quick "blip thrust" that is such an essential characteristic of the Camel (and rotary engined small aircraft in general).

Try taxiing with magnetos and throttle set to full power, while blipping on and off--you will see a big difference in Camel 2.0.

Additionally, the engine now has three distinct power settings based on magneto switchs: switch 1 (low power), switch 2 (medium power), and both switches (full power).  Switch 1 is weakest and blipping it on/off results in low power addition--perfect for trimming approach to landing etc. Switch 2 brings a greater power surge when blipped on/off. Switches 1&2 together provide the greatest power. The blip effect is the same whether operated from the switch or via the blip switch (ie, switch 1 on/off is the same as switch 1 on plus blip switch on/off).

In a real rotary Camel engine, the power differential was created by turning off spark to various cylinders. The blip switch turned off all spark, magneto 1 turns on some cylinders (usually just lower than half; rotary engines always had an odd number of cylinders), magneto 2 turns on more cyclinders (usually the ones turned off by magneto 1 are turned on by magneto 2 and vice-versa) and magneto 1+2 turns on spark to all cylinders.  Fuel and oil continue to turn to all cylinders regardless of magneto settings, but just flipping a magneto switch or two gave very quick and very large changes in thrust.

Additionally, in Ver. 2.0 the engine stays running as long as the aircraft is moving or the engine has any RPMs.  In Ver. 1.8 the engine would sometimes cut out, requiring a mid-air re-start, when blipped in some situations. The current 2.0 behavior is more consistent with operations in the real Camel.

Typical operating procedure:

 - 1. Low power (i.e, landing): Magneto switch 1 on, control power on/off with Blip switch (or with Switch 1 on/off)
 - 2. Moderate power: Magneto switch 2 on, control power on/off with Blip switch (or Switch 2 on/off)
 - 3. Full power: Magneto switches 1 and 2 on, control power on/off with Blip switch
 - Each of these three settings can be further fine tuned via the throttle.  This gives essentially three more power settings
 - Additionally, the blip switch gives a 'no power' setting

This gives a total of 7 distinct power settings by operating the various switches plus throttle high/low, with some additional fine tuning available via the throttle.  This is very, very similar system to that used in several rotary engines used in the Camel. Some engines included only magneto power control and entirely omitted the throttle.  But most included a throttle for fine tuning. In practice magneto power control--ie, blipping--was used routinely during high workload situations (taxiing, takeoff, approach and landing) but the throttle could be used to fine tune the engine during cruise or in special situations.

Taxiing and takeoff: Both magnetos engaged, full throttle, blip engine. Blipping the full power engine, engine torque etc, plus prop wash on the rudder and elevator, allowed pilots to move the tail and get around airfields quite well, even without a steerable tail drag.  Now you can duplicate much of that same functionality in FlightGear.

In windy conditions, use elevator to hold tail firmly down for better steering authority. 

Use 'n' to nudge the aircraft a bit while taxiing, especially away from regular airfields.  This is the equivalent of calling your aircrew to push you out of a hole.

Landing: 

Throttle OPEN to 50% OPEN depending on preference & conditions. Magneto 1 ON, 
Magneto 2 OFF. Control engine power via Blip Switch (b); Engine is typically 
mostly OFF (via Blip) on approach. Note relatively steep glide slope (often 
described as 'almost 45 degree' though that is slightly exaggerated). Sideslip 
as needed to control speed. If you need emergency full power, add Magneto 2 and/
or full throttle.

Approach speed 55 KTS (63 mph) : Threshhold speed 48 KTS (55 mph) : Touchdown speed: 40 KTS (45-50 mph)

Stall speed: 41 KTS (48 mph) IAS.

UPDATE: 2.0delta: 1st hand reports of stall speed @35-40 mph are at odds with 
official reports listing stall speed at 41 KTS (48 mph). Re-read of these 
suggests that these aircraft may be lightened or stripped down in a few ways 
(no guns, no ammo, no bombs, perhaps a lighter engine, smaller fuel load or 
only partically filled, etc) which suggests that the varyingly reported stall 
speeds may simply be the result of aircraft loaded down or fully loaded in 
combat configuration. The intent here is to replicate the fully combat-loaded 
configuration, so rebalancing of configuration & engine to 41 KTS (48 mph) stall 
speed has been accomplished for 2.0delta.  Now the stall speed is 48 mph (
slightly less when in ground effect, and even less when fuel is low), TAS 
speed at 6500, 10000, and 15,000 feet is met very closely, and climb time to 
6500 ft, 10000 ft, and 15000 ft is also modeled very closely. In addition, this 
is done while using the historical engineering data for lift and zero-lift drag 
coefficient, without any alterations or adjustment needed. Lift-drag ratio is 
much closer to that reported in historical records, as well.  


==============
TO DO/WISHLIST
==============

* "Realism mode" (probably for Bombable?) where unlimited ammo, warping your 
current position, outside views, etc are disallowed.

* Could make wing, tail, other parts break or show damage on bad landing
 
* ALS fuselage shadow currently displays directly under the aircraft. An update could make it display at the currect angle per the sun's position. (Various
FG technical considerations prevent this from being easy to implement right 
now.)

* Cockpit shadows.

* Engine disable: Right now this is handled by turning off magneto switches but not changing the visual state of the switches, leading to confusion.  Some interaction with the Bombable add-on here.
 
* Engine loss of power at high altitudes - JSBSim compression setting could 
possibly use some refining it implement this feature this way rather than
the way it is currently implemented in JSBSim.  Additionally, tweaking the
compression settings should help the issue with the
'mixture needs adjustment at 250 feet' in the real Camel that isn't happening 
yet in the JSBSim Camel.  In general, we have a mixture setting and it needs
to be tweaked at certain altitudes, but it doesn't exactly correspond with 
the mixture settings that a real Camel would have needed.

* Engine heating/overheating isn't implemented.  Need some kind of dial or indicator?
 
* Implement other engine controls--mixture, pressurizing fuel tank, etc--that required constant attention and often distracted pilots at crucial moments, as commonly described by Camel pilots.
 
* Apparently long periods of blipping could foul the engine - this isn't 
modelled yet.

* Engine power @ various magneto settings: We now have three distinct settings--
some research & testing may be required to determine whether the power output of 
each setting matches the historically accurate amount.  Improved in 2.0 delta
but may require more research/work.
  
* Taxiing, beginning of takeoff roll: Currently the tail drag is steerable and has considerable control authority because that is the only way I could figure out how to make taxiing feasible in FG. But real WWI Camels had no steerable tail drag and even today pilots seem to be able to maneuver on the ground quite well using rudder, blip, etc.  So perhaps we can model this more closely; this would also help the takeoff rollout transition from tail drag to rudder control.  [Large improvements to this situation in Ver. 2.0 but perhaps even more realism can be attained.]
 
* Some ground interactions at slow speed especially, and involving the tail drag especially, seem perhaps too sticky or bumpy. 

* Ground effects: Dust could be different colors etc depending on type of ground.

* FUEL: Fix fuel and/or make sure fuel consumption is modelled correctly, weight distribution changes, a/c runs out of fuel appropriately, there is some way to check fuel remaining. Fuel.nas is currently used by may have YASim specific code. Fuel usage is working and at least reasonable accurate. 2.0delta upgraded
fuel tank location & mass to be more accurate.
 
* Generally improve ground interactions, structure breakage, etc.
 
* Model wing breakage during high-g maneuvers and/or touching a wing too hard on landing or crash, damage from crashing on the nose, damage from gunfire/weapons in various parts?

* Fix 'could not find construction' error: Seems to be a spurious entry in 
sopwithCamel-model-Y.xml

* Re-evaluate/re-check speed, climb rates, etc as compared with original Camel & add these items to the NOTES checklist of historical Camel characteristics.  They were checked & improved in ver. 2.0 but further refinement of characteristics at different altitudes, climb rates, etc is still possible.
  
* Save/restore menu settings on quit/restart

* Spin force in some stall situations may be a bit too strong or too strong too early in the stall
 
* Don't make explosion sound/smoke on 'successful' water landing 
 
* Refine gyroscopic moment; it may be dialed down too low now. Perhaps it could be made user adjustable in some way.
 
* Implement wing flexer module?  Even though it seems a little overkill for such a small, well braced aircraft, getting the 3d model to have separate & rotatable wings is also a good step towards being able to show wing damage. http://wiki.flightgear.org/Wingflexer Technical Report of the Advisory committee for aeronautics for the year 1915 - 1916: "Tests of wings of BE2a No.226 (1 October 1912) the wing was loaded to a factor of safety of 6. Maximum deflections of 2.28 inches for "Front" at "A" (I assume at the outboard interplane strut on the front spar ?) and 4.35 inches for "Rear" at "B" (I assume on the at the outboard interplane strut on the rear spar?) were recorded.

* Integrate the JSBSim Camel into FGData so it is an officially adopted FG Aircraft 
 
* JSBSim Camel seems to have a lower framerate than some other aircraft under 
Rembrandt, only when sitting in cockpit; figure out why & see if it can be 
fixed.
 
* Don't do the 'nudge' thing on blip or 'n' when the chocks are in--sometimes
it will push you out of the chocks.  Improved in 2.0delta but may require more 
work.

* Make a companion aircraft from the same era, matched in FG development and 
capabilities, as a ideal dogfighting partner?  Perhaps the Fokker Dr. 1 or 
Fokker D.IV? Pfalz D.III? Albatros D.III?  (Dr.1 is probably best?  It's the 
classic match up.)
