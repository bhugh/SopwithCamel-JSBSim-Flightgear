==============
TO DO/WISHLIST
==============

* Chocks display (B) but don't do anything. Make them act as brakes/keep a/c at a standstill.

* Could make wing/tail etc break or show damage on bad landing

* Transition from tail drag to tail fly @ 20-35-40 KTS is difficult, rudder seems to have insufficient control authority, or some interaction between ground & aero forces.

* Blip: Make sure blip switches on dash always accurately show actual state of blips.  Make sure blip switches are turned on when a/c is repaired, restarted etc & switches show that properly.  Use the camel blip nasal routine instead of just changing the prop directly.

* Engine disable: Right now this is handled by turning off blip switches, leading to confusiong

* FUEL: Fix fuel and/or make sure fuel consumption is modelled correctly, weight distribution changes, a/c runs out of fuel appropriately, there is some way to check fuel remaining

* "Nudge":  If stuck in a field, etc etc create a menu entry or key to give a little nudge to get you unstuck

* Wheel thump on landing, maybe tail dragging sounds, other sounds that help you know what's going on

* Often (incorrectly) detects view/select airport change as  'crash'.
 
* Low pass filter for 'bumpiness'.

===========================
CHANGES/UPDATES/THINGS DONE
===========================

VER 2.0
-------

* Major updates to Flight Dynamics Model, significant better fit to historically reported behavior

* Ground contact effects: Dust, dirt, wake when wheels, tail, prop, fuselage etc contact the ground or water

* Parts break: Wheels, undercarriage, & prop will break if they contact the 
ground with too much force. Both visual & physics affects of broken parts are 
apparent.

* Ground/water crash behavior much improved; solved problems with JSBSim when 
violent ground crashes occur. Pilot is kicked out of plane in crash,
explosionsound, smoke/dust clouds, (some) parts break appropriately, somewhat 
reasonable aircraft physics displayed @ crash (vs previous versions that tended 
to just 'bounce off the ground')

* Sound effects: Blip, air rushing (useful for detecting stall/overspeed), 
overspeed whooshing, high G creaks & ominous rumbles, landing gear and 
taildragger rumble, if you touch a wing it slides, water landings have their own 
sound effects, buffeting aloft, etc.  Sound effects help you make a connection 
between what you're doing in the aircraft and the world you are interacting 
with, so I've tried to include sound effects that help you know what is going on 
with the aircraft.

* Repair aircraft after crash or parts broken: Available in Camel/Repair menu or 
* automatically completed when appropriate choice is made in 'crash menu'. 

* Improved documentation

* Fixed could not find 'construction' error: Seems to be a spurious entry in 
sopwithCamel-model-Y.xml
