		<line>STARTING OUT</line>
		
		<line>Press { and } once each - so that both L and R magneto switches are in upward position. Check that Blip Switch ('b' key,</line>
		<line>visible button on Camel's joystick handle) is disengaged. Check throttle @ 100%.  Press and hold the 's' key for 0.5 seconds.</line>
    <line>It may take several tries before the engine catches. If you spawn in on the ground, chocks are in place. Shift-B to remove.  </line> 
		<line> </line>
   
		<line>TAKE OFF</line>		
		<line>Always take off directly INTO wind regardless of runway configuration. Zoom view full out; steer via peripheral vision.  </line>
		<line>Easiest, most dependable way to take off: Full throttle, moderate back-pressure on stick to keep </line>
		<line>tail engaged w/ ground. Use rudder to steer (tail dragging on ground provides most control authority).</line>
		<line>3-point lift-off @ 40-45 KTS (45-50 mph); immediately ease stick forward to avoid excessive climb, loss of airspeed, stall.</line>
    <line>More advanced/Calm conditions: Gently lift tail @ 30-35 mph and continue rolling (or in ground effect) through 50-55 mph before lift-off.</line>
    <line>Crashing on takeoff? Check wind and weather - many real Camel pilots crashed on take-off/landing with strong crosswind or tailwind.</line>
    <line> </line>
    
    <line>THROTTLE, BLIP SWITCH, AND MAGNETOS</line>    
		<line>Real Camel pilots used a combination of throttle, magneto settings, and the blip switch to achieve desired power</line>
    <line>settings. Throttle provides a limited range of power settings. The blip switch (b) disengages both magnetos and cuts</line>
    <line>power totally. Engaging either R or L brake (via keyboard, joystick, or rudder/pedals) also engages the blip switch.</line>
    <line>Releasing the brake (or releasing the 'b' key) releases the blip switch. Engaging only one magneto ('{' or '}') </line> 
    <line>reduces engine power to just under half (L magneto) and just over half (R magneto).</line>
    <line>This gives you 3 distinct power settings via magneto (L, R, or both) - you can fine-tune each of them with the throttle.</line>
    <line>Note that L magneto ON/R magneto OFF + Blip switch gives you very fine low-power control for, e.g., approach and landing.</line>        
    <line></line>
    
    <line>NEGATIVE G - INVERTED FLIGHT</line>
		<line>The Camel's fuel system requires gravity to feed fuel to the engine.  If you fly inverted or pull negative Gs, the</line>
		<line>engine will soon stop.  Once you return to upright flight, fuel will flow and the engine will start again.</line>
		<line> </line>
   
		<line>APPROACH AND LANDING</line>	
    <line>Land directly into wind regardless of runway layout. Throttle FULL OPEN, L Magneto ON, R Magneto OFF. Control engine </line>
    <line>power via Blip Switch (b); Engine is typically mostly OFF (via Blip) on approach. Note relatively steep glide slope. Sideslip as needed</line>
    <line>to control speed. On runout, hold tail firmly down to act as brake.</line>
    <line>Unstable or ground loop on landing? Just add full power (R Magneto ON) and go around.</line>
		<line>Approach speed 55 KTS (60-65 mph) : Threshhold speed 48 KTS (55 mph) : Touchdown speed: 40 KTS (45-50 mph)</line>    
		<line>Stall speed 41 KTS (48 mph) : Best Climb speed 55 KTS (60-65 mph) (all IAS)</line>
		<line> </line>
   
		<line>GUNS</line>
		<line>Guns have 400 rounds each, the maximum capacity of the Camel.</line>
    <line>Fire with the 'e' key or a joystick trigger linked to /controls/armament/trigger. </line>
    <line>Reload guns: Use the Camel Menu - you must be on ground, stopped, engine off. </line>
   
    <line> </line> 
		<line>MISC </line>
    <line>TAXIING: In windy conditions, use elevator to hold tail firmly down for better steering authority. At high RPM, prop wash</line>
    <line>gives some rudder and elevator authority even at near stand-still. Use this plus the burst of power from Blip to</line>
    <line>help maneuver and taxi over bumps. Don't forget 'n' for nudge when you get stuck.</line>
    <line>STALL: Push forward firmly on the stick, gain airspeed. Vigorously oppose any spin (rudder and ailerons).  It may help to blip</line>
    <line>engine off, reducing torque and gyroscopic moment. You will lose ~500 ft altitude or more.</line>
    <line>TRIM: Real Camels had no trim mechanism and were tail heavy with full fuel - nose heavy with low fuel. Beware of stall @ full fuel!</line>
